Storage for exercises &amp; drills from Programming: Principles &amp; Practice using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup (2nd Edition)

I don't use Github for source control; I use Perforce. I'm currently using Github as code storage only so cloning from this repository probably won't work (more so on the graphics chapters).

I started this book in January 2016 at 25 with no prior programming knowlege as I woke up one morning and decided to be a software engineer. I applied to do a degree in Software Engineering & Game Development starting September 2016 and they used C++.

My solutions aren't the best. I try not to spend all of my free time programming so I skip testing (80% of the time) and detection for things like bad input (I don't at work because I get paid to write good code there...at home I'll write as much shitty code as I want). So beware if you want to use my code. 

For the most part I don't change already uploaded exercises (unless there's a serious error) because I like to go back at past coding me and laugh at my stupid solutions.

Thank you.
