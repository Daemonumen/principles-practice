Storage for exercises &amp; drills from Programming: Principles &amp; Practice using C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup (2nd Edition)

I don't use Github for source control; I use Perforce. I'm currently using Github as code storage only so cloning from this repository probably won't work (more so on the graphics chapters).

All the exercises have been completed using Visual Studio Community 2015/2017/2019. I moved onto using C++17 from around Chapter 17 onwards.

I started this book in January 2016 at 25 with no prior programming knowlege as I woke up one morning and decided to be a software engineer. I applied to do a degree in Software Engineering & Game Development starting September 2016 and they used C++.

My solutions aren't the best. I try not to spend all of my free time programming so I skip testing (80% of the time) and detection for things like bad input. So beware if you want to use my code. 

For the most part I don't change already uploaded exercises (unless there's a serious error) because I like to go back at past coding me and laugh at my stupid solutions.

Thank you.
